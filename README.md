## Contribute
I welcome valuable contributions to improve this repository with valuable additions and ideas on the shared topics.
Please note that small contributions (like finding a single typo) will not be merged into the repository. Your contribution will be considered if you find at least three to five errors or can contribute in other significant ways.

## How do I contribute?
To contribute to this repository, please follow the steps below:

### Create an issue 
Identify areas that require improvement and create an issue in the repository. Clearly describe the problem or suggestion to gather feedback from others.

### Fork the repository
To make your own copy of the repository under your GitHub account, click the "Fork" button in the repository.

### Clone the repository
Create a local copy of the repository on your computer by using Git to clone it.
```
git clone <repository_url>
```

### Create a branch
For your contributions, create a new branch in the repository. This ensures that your changes remain separate from the main branch and allows for better management and review.

To create a new branch in Git, use the following command:
```
git branch <branch_name>
```
Put your new branch's name in place of `branch_name>`.

To switch to the newly created branch, you can use the following command:

```
git checkout <branch_name>
```
This will switch to the new branch and allow you to start making changes within that branch.

### Make your changes
Add the improvements or additions you want to make to the content within your local branch. This may involve editing existing files, adding important missing points, or removing outdated content.

### Commit and push
Once you have made your changes, commit them with a clear and descriptive message. Push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

To stage all modified files, you can use the following command:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

Now commit the changes with a clear and descriptive message using the following command:

   ```
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   ```

After you have committed your changes, use the following command to push them to your forked repository on GitHub:

   ```
   git push origin <branch_name>
   ```

Replace `<branch_name>` with the name of your branch. This will push your changes to the corresponding branch in your forked repository on GitHub.


### Submit a pull request
Now is the time to submit a pull request. Visit the original repository on GitHub and submit a pull request from your branch. Clearly explain the purpose of your contribution and highlight the changes you have made. This will notify me and other contributors of your proposed changes.

The likelihood of a contribution being merged into the main branch depends on how well it meets the repository's requirements and adds value. Please note that small contributions like those with a single typo, may not be merged. 

All the best!
